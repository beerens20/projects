      <p>We have been a part of Walk to Remember from day one. We lost our daughter, Ainsley, in July 2013 at 36 weeks gestation. After having this experience, we found that there was not a lot of support in the community for those of us who have had a loss as this. Having the support and meeting so many who have had this journey helps to heal the heart. We found this support within the members of Walk to Remember. We are happy to be a part of such an amazing organization. </p>
