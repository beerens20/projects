# Housing Allowance Calculator

### The purpose of this project:
The purpose of this tool is to help the user understand how much of their take home pay could safetly be spent on housing.

##### Explination
The general rule of thumb is that you should not spend more than 30% of your gross monthly income on housing.  Overspending in any budget category can be troublesome but that is particulary true when it comes to housing due to the fact that if someone is unable to maintain that spend they could end up homeless.  In my personal life i have run into many people who are just not good at budgeting or never were taught how to / the importance of budgeting their money.  My hope in creating this calculator is to allow people to quickly determine if their housing spend may be higher than recommended and therefore potentially unsustainable.
